This snippets are my solution to the bug in Nuxt's Dark Mode toggle button wich didn't watch the client's preference by default and was always starting as light mode even if it wasn't matching with the real situation. ONLY HAPPENED BEFORE THE FIRST CLICK.
Now the button shows the correct mode from the first moment.
